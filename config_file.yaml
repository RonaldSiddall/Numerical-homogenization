 # This YAML configuration file is used to specify parameters and settings for the simulation process
 # of the numerical homogenization of mechanical properties for 2D problems.
 
 # The config file allows the user to change the simulation parameters such as mesh dimensions, material
 # properties, load matrices and has a choice between three different geometries
 
 # Apart from that the user can adjust the directory settings for input/output files,
 # settings for the file with the results and additional settings for the simulation process.
