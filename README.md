# Numerical homogenisation of mechanical properties
## Semestral project - Ronald Ch. Siddall, AVI FM TUL
This project implements a program for numerical homogenization of mechanical properties, specifically designed for computational simulation using Flow123d. The program includes several auxiliary software components and scripts to streamline the entire process from user input to result output.
## Prerequisites
To use the implemented program for numerical homogenization, you need to first install/download this software:

- **Flow123d** - computational simulator (download link: [Flow123d official website](https://flow123d.github.io/))
- **GitHub repository** - clone this repository with the complete code 

All other needed programs are listed in the documentation of Flow123d. 
## How to run numerical homogenization on Windows
Assuming all the mentioned software and programs were successfully installed/downloaded, the implemented program is almost ready to use.
The only complication is the need to reinstall some Python modules/packages (e.g., pyvista, sympy, ruamel.yaml) every time the terminal is opened. To solve this, **download the Dockerfile from this GitHub repository**, which includes these required Python packages. Once the Dockerfile is downloaded, you need to create a new Docker image. 

**The steps to create a new Docker image are as follows:**
  - Open the command line in the folder where the Dockerfile is located
  - Run the following command to create the Docker image (using "flow123d_siddall" as an example name):
    ```
    docker build -t flow123d_siddall
    ```
If the Dockerfile lists all the necessary Python libraries, you can start the Flow123d terminal using the `fterm_siddall.bat` file.
