## Semestral project - Ronald Ch. Siddall, AVI FM TUL

In the future, a README will be written here to describe the correct use of the program, i.e. a user manual and general info about everything...

To be done list (or just ideas):

 - fix visualisation - perhaps save visualisation to pdf?
 - solve: how to run program from Windows (now only functional for Linux)
 - solve: how to make installations of modules (in Linux) automatic?
 - update user interface - needs reworking
 - fix time displaying in automatic simulating (time zone) - 2 hours off
 - add a class diagram into GitHub?
 - consider function to make graphs directly from python?
 - consider adding functionality to change load matrices?
 - consider adding functionality to change load matrices?
